### Exercise: Creating Relationships in SwiftData Models

## Overview

In this exercise, you'll learn how to establish and manage relationships between models using SwiftData. You'll work with `Tag`, `Note`, `NoteSummary`, `NotebookContainer`, and `ContentView` to ensure that tags are correctly associated with notes.

### Objective

By the end of this exercise, you'll be able to:
- Establish and manage relationships between SwiftData models.

### Instructions

1. **Starter:**
   - Navigate to the `starter` folder and open `NotebookApp.xcodeproj`.
   - Your task is to implement the missing code as indicated by comments in the Swift files:
     - `Tag.swift`
     - `Note.swift`
     - `NoteSummary.swift`
     - `NotebookContainer.swift`
     - `ContentView.swift`
   - Follow the instructions outlined in the comments within each file to establish and manage relationships between models.

2. **Solution:**
   - After completing the exercise, or if you need to check your work, you can find the complete code in the `solution` folder.
   - Compare your solution with the completed code to understand different approaches or to debug any issues you encountered.

### Setup

- Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed on your Mac.
- Open the Xcode project from the `starter` folder to begin the exercise.

### Note

- The data added and modified in this app will persist across app restarts, as it is saved using SwiftData.
