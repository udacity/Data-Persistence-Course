### Exercise: Querying Data with Relationships in SwiftData Models

## Overview

In this exercise, you'll enhance the Notebook app by implementing and refining queries to handle relationships in SwiftData models. You'll build upon the `ContentView` class, focusing on querying notes and tags based on their relationships.

### Objective

By the end of this exercise, you'll be able to:
- Query data with relationships in a SwiftData app.

### Instructions

1. **Starter:**
   - Navigate to the `starter` folder and open `NotebookApp.xcodeproj`.
   - Your task is to implement the missing code as indicated by comments in the Swift file `ContentView.swift`.
   - Follow the instructions outlined in the comments to implement queries for data relationships.

2. **Solution:**
   - After completing the exercise, or if you need to check your work, you can find the complete code in the `solution` folder.
   - Compare your solution with the completed code to understand different approaches or to debug any issues you encountered.

### Setup

- Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed on your Mac.
- Open the Xcode project from the `starter` folder to begin the exercise.

### Note

- The data added and modified in this app will persist across app restarts, as it is saved using SwiftData.

Happy coding!
