### Exercise: Creating, Saving, and Filtering Notes

## Overview

You will enhance the notes app by adding functionality to create new notes, save them locally, and implement basic filtering to search through notes.

#### Objective
- Create new data entries in the notes app.
- Save data locally within the app's session.
- Implement a filter to search through notes based on the title.

#### Instructions

1. **Starter:**
   - Navigate to the `starter` folder and open `NotebookApp.xcodeproj`.
   - Your task is to implement missing code as indicated by comments in the Swift file (`ContentView.swift`).
   - Follow the instructions outlined in the comments within the file to add functionality for adding, saving, and filtering notes.

2. **Solution:**
   - After completing the exercise, or if you need to check your work, you can find the complete code in the `solution` folder.
   - Compare your solution with the completed code to understand different approaches or to debug any issues you encountered.

#### Setup
- Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed on your Mac.
- Open the Xcode project from the `starter` folder to begin the exercise.

#### Note
- The data added and modified in this app is temporarily stored and will not persist across app restarts. This setup is intended for learning and demonstration purposes.
