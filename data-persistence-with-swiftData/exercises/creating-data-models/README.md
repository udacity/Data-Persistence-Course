### Exercise: Integrating SwiftData Models into NotebookApp

## Overview

In this exercise, you will integrate SwiftData models into the NotebookApp, replacing mock models and storage classes. This transition will enhance your app's data handling capabilities and prepare you for more advanced data management and app architecture techniques.

## Objectives
- Convert the `Note` class into a SwiftData model.
- Replace the mock models and storage classes with SwiftData entities.
- Configure the SwiftData environment, initialize the `ModelContainer`, and inject it into the `App.swift` file.
- Setup the `ModelContainer` for use throughout the app.

## Instructions

1. **Convert Note to SwiftData Model**:
   - Navigate to the `starter` folder and open `NotebookApp.xcodeproj`.
   - Update the `Note` class to be a final class using the `@Model` macro. Ensure it conforms to SwiftData requirements.

2. **Initialize and Configure ModelContainer**:
   - In the `NotebookAppApp.swift`, implement the initialization of the `ModelContainer` to manage `Note` entities. Properly handle initialization errors.

3. **Inject ModelContainer into the Environment**:
   - Modify the `ContentView` to accept the `ModelContainer` from the environment and utilize it properly within the app.

## Starter
- You will find the initial setup in the `starter` folder where some parts of the code are omitted for you to fill in.

## Solution
- After completing the tasks, or if you need to refer to the complete code, visit the `solution` folder.
- Compare your implementation to the provided solution to understand different approaches or troubleshoot any issues.

## Setup
- Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed on your Mac.
- Open the Xcode project from the `starter` folder to begin the exercise.

## Additional Notes
- This exercise aims to provide a practical understanding of how to structure and manage data within an iOS application using SwiftData.
